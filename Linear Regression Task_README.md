#Description: The dataset aims to predict the progression of diabetes with respect to various attributes of the people sampled. In this task, I cleaned and scaled the data and generated a training and test set. I then fitted a multilinear regression model. I generated predictions for the test set and then calculated the R Squared value for the model.
